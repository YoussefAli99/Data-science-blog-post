If you have Anaconda 3 distribution you should face no issues running the file.

I was interestested in using CoronaVirus data to answer these questions:<br>

- Is first world countries much safer than third ones?
- What is the speed that the coronavirus is spreading by?
- How about the total number of death?
- Is it recommended to travel these days?
